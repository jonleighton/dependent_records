h2. Dependent Records

This Rails plugin reflects on a model's associations, and returns a hash
of those which:

# Are not join associations
# Have the option @:dependent => :destroy@
# Are not empty
# Are one-to-many or many-to-many

I use it to show the user what the consequences of deleting a particular
record will be.

h2. Example

<pre><code>Company.has_many :employees, :dependent => :destroy
@company.dependent_records
# => {"employees"=>[#(Employee id: 1), #(Employee id: 2)]}</code></pre>
