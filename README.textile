h2. Dependent Records

This Rails plugin reflects on a model's associations, and returns a hash
of those which:

  1. Are not join associations
  2. Have the option @:dependent => :destroy@
  3. Are not empty
  4. Are one-to-many or many-to-many

I use it to show the user what the consequences of deleting a particular
record will be.

h2. Example

<pre><code>Company.has_many :employees, :dependent => :destroy
@company.dependent_records
# => {"employees"=>[#<Employee id: 1>, #<Employee id: 2>]}</code></pre>
